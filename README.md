Hi, my name is Areesha Noor. I spent four days making this Ludo game because its coding is very extensive, and even a small mistake can stop the entire website. Despite my efforts, it’s still not working on my website. I followed a YouTube tutorial and tried many times, but I can’t understand what the problem is. This is why I’m sharing the link to the YouTuber who created the game and my code. I’m sure there’s no problem with my code, but for some reason, it’s not working. I don’t know why. If you know a way to solve the problem with my code, please tell me.
